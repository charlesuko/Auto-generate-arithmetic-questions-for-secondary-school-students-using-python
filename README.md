# Auto-generate-arithmetic-questions-for-secondary-school-students-using-python
Simple program using XlsxWriter and python to auto geanerate arithmetic questions for students. XlsxWriter is a Python module for creating Excel XLSX files.


Reason for this project: Taught arithmetic in a secondary school and was

given the task to set daily multiplication drill questions for junior

secondary school students over the course of two weeks. Wrote code to

automate the process because, no time for stress. I plan to build a GUI

for it using tkinter and expand functionality in the future. You will

need to install the xlsxwriter module to get this to work, since a bulk

of the program depends on it.
